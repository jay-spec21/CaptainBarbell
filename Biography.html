            <h2>The Barbell</h2>
            <p>A young boy named Enteng would lift the magical barbell to become Captain Barbell.
            In previous Captain Barbell films, the Barbell which was given to Teng by an old man is the literal barbell that we know. However,
            in the TV series, the Barbell looks like a medallion with "CB" engraved on it. The name "Captain B" is also depicted on the medallion.
            Teng twists the medallion and it forms into a barbell, raises it and shouts "Captain Barbell" to change him into the superhero. As Captain Barbell,
            the medallion is depicted in his chest. To go back to his human form as Teng, he just grabs the medallion on his chest. The medallion is said to be made from Barbanium,
            a powerful element discovered in the year 2016. Only an equally powerful Askobar can counter its power.</p>

            <h2>The Costume</h2>
            <p>Captain Barbell suit in the 2006 TV series was designed by Filipino artist Reno Maniquis and was made by Miles Teves,
            a renowned Filipino-American costume maker in Hollywood. Teves is credited for the Batman, Spider-Man, Superman and RoboCop costumes.
            He was commissioned by Zaldy and Gina Ravelo of Mars Ravelo Marvelous Characters, Inc. to design the new look to make it CB's official costume.
            It was Dominic Zapata who suggested to the producers to have the costume made by Teves. Captain Barbell's updated suit is a far cry from the "Superman" inspired spandex
            tight fitting suit in shades of yellow, blue and red. The muscular costume is more inspired by the Batman's bulky costume, minus the mask and in shades of yellow for the suit,
            gold for CB logo and other embellishments, and red for the cape. The suit reportedly costs $50,000 excluding the charges for repairs in case of damages, making it the 
            most expensive costume ever made for a single character in a Philippine film or TV series, for that matter.</p>
